# Spriter
Sprite generator  
Based on http://tools.putpixel.com/spritegen.html

I wanted cool sprites without the creativity block that always happens...  
Soon I found the site of putpixel generating several small sprites and thought: **cool, but it is not Ruby...**
Inspecting the element I found the source with **DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE**, and I started.

It was December 2013, created my own version with most of the algorithm intact.
Then the integer probability and seed control made easier to handle the beast.
Found out the other day lost in my HD, optimized a little bit (30%) and here we are.

# TODOs
- Image class without dependencies
- Optional clean step
- Support odd proportions
- Color based on neighbor count
